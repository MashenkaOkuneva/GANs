# GANs
This is a repo containing materials on GANs from Udacity.
## Step 1. Generating new images of handwritten digits that look as if they've come from the original MNIST training data.
See **gan-mnist** folder.

## Step 2. Batch normalization.
See **batch-norm** folder.

## Step 3. Deep convolutional GANs.
See **dcgan-svhn** folder.

## Step 4. Implement a CycleGAN.
See **cycle-gan** folder.
